        <h2>1. What is the purpose of this research project?</h2>
        <p>This research project aims to improve understanding of how information gathering can impact decision-making processes, cognitive load, and trust when performing data classification tasks relevant to cybersecurity scenarios.</p>
        <h2>2. Why have I been invited to take part?</h2>
        <p>You have been invited because you are a volunteer who fits the task requirements.</p>
        <h2>3. Do I have to take part?</h2>

        <p>The research project will take place either at university or at a location of your choosing. We kindly ask that you select a quiet, distraction-free environment to ensure accurate results. You will be asked to perform a cybersecurity data classification task which will involve reviewing incoming data points and categorising them as "Trusted," "Suspect," or "Hostile" based on provided rules whilst your gaze is being recorded. </p>
        <p>After the task, you will complete a question about your perceived accuracy, and provide feedback on the study itself, the entire study should take around an hour.</p>
        <h2>5. Will I be paid for taking part?</h2>
        <p>No, however, if you are on EMS you will be provided with the appropriate course credits. </p>
        <h2>6. What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h2>
        <p>There will be no direct advantages or benefits to you from taking part, but your contribution will help us understand the impact that various strategies of information gathering can have on decision making.</p>
        <h2>7. What are the possible risks of taking part?</h2>
